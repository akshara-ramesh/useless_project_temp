# BunkBank üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Elite Brigade


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Akshara - NSS College Of Engineering, Palakkad

### Project Description
A fun web app that lets students track their missed classes ("bunks"), manage them with a virtual bunk bank, generate creative excuses, and compete on leaderboards!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Students often lose track of how many classes they‚Äôve bunked and struggle to come up with believable excuses on the spot.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An interactive, gamified web app that stores your bunks, lets you ‚Äúwithdraw‚Äù or ‚Äúadd‚Äù bunks, and generates funny or formal excuses automatically ‚Äî all in one place!
